Code Action Request

https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol/blob/master/protocol.md#code-action-request

The code action request is sent from the client to the server tocompute commands
for a given text document and range. These commands are typically code fixes to
either fix problems or to beautify/refactor code. The result of a
textDocument/codeAction request is an array of Command literals which are
typically presented in the user interface. When the command is selected the
server should be contacted again (via the workspace/executeCommand) request to
execute the command.

Since version 3.8.0: support for CodeAction litarals to enable the following
scenarios:

the ability to directly return a workspace edit from e code action request. This
avoids having another server roundtrip to execute an actual code action. However
server providers should be aware that if the code action is expensive to compute
or the edits are huge it might still be beneficial if the result is imply a
command and the actual edit is only computed when needed. the ability to group
code actions using a kind. Clients are allowed to ignore that information.
However it allows them to better group code action for example into
corresponding menus (e.g. all refactor code actions into a refactor menu).
Clients need to announce there support code action literals and code action
kinds via the corresponding client capability
textDocument.codeAction.codeActionLiteralSupport.
