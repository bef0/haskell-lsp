Completion Request

The Completion request is sent from the client to the server to compute
completion items at a given cursor position. Completion items are presented in
the IntelliSense user interface. If computing full completion items is
expensive, servers can additionally provide a handler for the completion item
resolve request ('completionItem/resolve'). This request is sent when a
completion item is selected in the user interface. A typically use case is for
example: the 'textDocument/completion' request doesn't fill in the documentation
property for returned completion items since it is expensive to compute. When
the item is selected in the user interface then a 'completionItem/resolve'
request is sent with the selected completion item as a param. The returned
completion item should have the documentation property filled in.

    Changed: In 2.0 the request uses TextDocumentPositionParams with a proper
    textDocument and position property. In 1.0 the uri of the referenced text
    document was inlined into the params object.

Request
